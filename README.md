# ElectronicComponentParts
To scale vector files of individual electronic components to be used for breadboard or perf/protoboard layout planning.
These are meant for prototyping circuits that use hand soldering and through hole components. 
To use, set your move distance to 0.1 in or 2.54 mm to easily move parts between holes.
Hit me up if there's a part you need that you don't see. I can whip these up pretty quickly.
